Displaying Awards: To display the awards carousel on a page or post, users simply need to add the [awards] shortcode to the content area.
Carousel Functionality: The awards are displayed in a responsive carousel that adapts to different screen sizes. The carousel includes navigation buttons and pagination for easy navigation.
